# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Study Guide was created for students going through the EdX boot camp Prework to help them to easily add and access notes on HTML,CSS,Git and JavaScript.

While working on this project, I learnt how to create a structure for a Webpage using HTML, as well as how to change the look of it by using CSS, and added interactivity using JavaScript. I also learnt how to work on a project using the Command line and GitHub.

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Coomand+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the Webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
